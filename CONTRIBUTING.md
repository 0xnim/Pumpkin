## Contributing to Pumpkin

Pumpkin is an open-source project that welcomes contributions. There are many ways to contribute, but if you want to do so by providing code and implementing features, the following standard development workflow is recommended:

- Fork the repository
- Create a new branch
- Use a modern IDE that supports devcontainers (VSCode, IntelliJ, etc.)
- Wait for dependencies and tools to be installed
- Apply your changes
- Run the tests (WIP)
- Create a pull request

> If you need to take a peek at Mojang's server code, you can check it out in the `mc-source-code` folder by running the `decompile.sh` script. It will setup everything for you automatically.
