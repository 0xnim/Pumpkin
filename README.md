Pumpkin is a Minecraft server built entirely in Rust, offering a fast, efficient, 
and customizable experience. It prioritizes performance and player enjoyment while adhering to the core mechanics of the game.

Pumpkin is currently under heavy development.

### What Pumpkin wants to achive:
- **Performance**: Leveraging multi-threading for maximum speed and efficiency.
- **Compatibility**: Supports the latest Minecraft server version and adheres to vanilla game mechanics.
- **Security**: Prioritizes security by preventing known exploits.
- **Flexibility**: Highly configurable with the ability to disable unnecessary features.
- **Extensibility**: Provides a foundation for plugin development.

### What Pumpkin will not be:
- A direct replacement for Vanilla or Bukkit servers.
- A framework for building a server from scratch.
